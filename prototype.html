			Hello. My Name is <span style="color: darkorchid">Nick Mouzourakis</span>,
			<br>
			I was <span style="color: forestgreen;">Born and Raised in NH</span>,
			<br>
			and I Want to Give You the <span style="color: darkorchid">Choice</span>
			<br>
			that I <span style="color: darkorchid">Yearn</span> to <span style="color: darkorchid">Make</span> on <span style="color: darkorchid">Every Election</span>,
			<br>
			but <span style="color: blue;">Rarely Ever See</span> <span style="color: red;">on the Ballot</span>.
		</h1>
		<h2>
			My <span style="color: darkorchid">Political Promises</span> are Simple,
			<br>
			Small Enough to Fit on a Post Card,
			<br>
			and <span style="color: darkorchid">Realistic</span>, so that I can <span style="color: darkorchid">Achieve</span> them
			<br>
			Without <span style="color: red">either</span> <span style="color: blue">Party</span> <span style="color: red">Breathing</span> <span style="color: blue">Down</span> <span style="color: red">my</span> <span style="color: blue">Neck</span>

		</h2>
		<h2>
			<strong>Promise #1</strong>: I will Introduce a <a href="https://www.repair.org/stand-up#right-to-repair-br-data-preserve-html-node-true-faq-">Right-to-Repair</a> Bill,
			<br>
			so that 3rd-Party Repair Businesses can Give Competitive Quotes,
			<br>
			Reduce E-Waste, and Fix the Devices and Machines you Already Have
			<br>
			without Pressuring You to Buy a New Ones.
		</h2>
		<h2>
			<strong>Promise #2</strong>: I will Introduce a Bill
			<br>
			that Imposes Strict Consequences
			<br>
			on Companies that Negligently Lose your Private Data.
		</h2>
		Last Year, I Underwent a Background Check for a Job, only to be Told a Month Later that All my Private Data: my Name, Birth Date, Address, Employment History, Social Security Number, etc, had ALL been Lost to a Data Breach of this Company's Servers. My Legal Options however, were Essentially Nil, because this Company was neither a Hospital nor a Bank, and therefore Faced no Legal Accountability for their Negligence. As a Senior Software Security Engineer with over 14 Years of Experience, I am Uniquely Qualified to Solve this Problem.
		<h2>
			<strong>Promise #3</strong>: I will <span class="gradient-text">Build Bridges</span> between <span style="color: red">the</span> <span style="color: blue">Parties</span>
			<br>
			to come to <span style="color: darkorchid">Common-Sense Compromises</span> on Major Issues,
